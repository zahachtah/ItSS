In this lecture we welcome Carl Folke, Science Director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre. He will talk about an important foundation for understanding the problems and solutions related to sustainability.__Humans and nature are one system__. The functioning of ecosystems is seen today as how the activities of humans locally and globally, and the goods and services ecosystems provide (whether direct, such as timber and fuel, or indirect, such as by regulating precipitation patterns that determine our agricultural abilities), are integral to society.

* Imagine your favorite nature spot. Now try to envision the institutional arrangements that provide the basis for its existence, the people that work to maintain or develop it and that may often have strong emotional ties to it.
* Try to envision social scenarios, such as changes in regulation or economic conditions that would drastically change the way your nature spot will develop.
