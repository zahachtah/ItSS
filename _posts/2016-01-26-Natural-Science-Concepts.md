__Species__ are genetically distinct organisms that can successfully interbreed

__Populations__ are spatially or temporally defined subsets of species that may interact with other populations and disperse or move between other subsets of that species

__Predator prey interactions__ Consume or being consumed by organisms of other species within a food web. The degree of this interaction is determined by the functional response.

__Food webs__ are spatially or temporally defined subsets of populations that interact through predator/prey interactions.

__Ecosystems__ are spatially or temporally defined food webs and the abiotic environment that the organisms interact with

__Functional response__ is the shape of the predator/prey relationship between two populations. The shape of this response is generally a saturating function, i.e. a predator can only eat so much prey until it either becomes satiated or has to spend more time handling it prey than actually consuming it. This creates a non-linear relationship which gives rise to complex dynamics in food webs and ecosystems

__Green water__ is the water is the part of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere through evaporation or that drives plant growth (transpiration) and thus is a major source of water vapor released into the atmosphere and thus an important source of precipitation

__Blue water__ is the fresh water that accumulates in streams, rivers, lakes and ground.

__Biodiversity__ genetic, population, species and habitat variation(s). Most commonly refers to a measure of species richness, either numbers or some abundance weighted measure to take account of the degree of dominance/rareness between species.

__Attractor__ A set of conditions towards which a dynamical system evolves over time. An  attractor is often a point, but can also be a curve, a manifold, or a more complicated set  with a fractal structure known as a strange attractor. Also known as an equilibrium point.

__Critical threshold__ The point that separates two dynamic regimes. Also known as a tipping point or a bifurcation.

__Regime__ The set of system states that lead to a particular attractor, or represent  fluctuations around a specific attractor. Within this set of states the system self organizes into a specific structure and behaves in essentially the same way. Also known as a domain  of attraction, basin of attraction or stable state.

__Feedback loop__ A set of cause and effect relationships that form a closed loop, so that a change  in any particular element eventually feeds back to affect the element itself. Feedback loops  can either be damping (also known as negative or balancing) or amplifying (also known as  positive or reinforcing).

__Hysteresis__ The tendency of a system to remain in the same state when conditions change  due to lag effects and system memory. As a consequence the critical threshold for a  forward shift from Regime A to B often differs from the critical threshold for a return shift  from Regime B to A.

__Regime shift__ A large, abrupt, persistent change in the structure and function of a system  that occurs when a critical threshold is crossed and the system shifts from one dynamic  regime to another. Also known as a critical transition or a phase shift.

__Resilience__ The magnitude of change or disturbance that a system can tolerate before  undergoing a shift to an alternate regime.

__System state__ The condition of a system at a particular point in time, described in terms of  specific variables such as pH or population size.
