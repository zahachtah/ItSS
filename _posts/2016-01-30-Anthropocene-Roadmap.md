In this section of the course we will continue to get an __understanding of the problem__.

You will be guided through this section by a series of clips featuring Johan Rockstr√∂m in which he explains the challenges humanity faces and key concepts that will help us to contextualise the current state of things.

The Anthropocene is the greatest challenge for humanity and [the Great Acceleration](Greatacceleration.html) is the main driver behind the predicament. But it is not only accelerating pressure by human endeavours that drive the Anthropocene. We are the first generation of humans to have the facts to know without doubt that we undermining the capacity of the planet to sustain our way of life.

In addition to population growth and the associated increase in human metabolism we are narrowing or exceeding the margins of [planetary boundaries](planetaryboundaries.html). Human caused climate change, reduction in ecosystem capacity to produce the services that we depend on and a realization that the earth as a social-ecological and complex adaptive system does not behave in a linear fashion adds to our challenges and is sometimes referred to as the [quadruple squeeze](Quadrupelsqueeze.html).
