Johan Rockström is well known for being part of a group introducing the planetary boundaries concept in 2009. This concept provides a list of the main limits for planet earth and the current state of how close we are to surpassing these, or how much we already have done so.

* Try to relate your own style of living into the planetary boundaries concepts. Which of the boundaries are you probably most contributing to?

A statement that we have nine planetary boundaries that humanity must manage safely is a strong statement. Have we selected the right ones? Did we miss some? Here, Johan justifies the selection of these boundaries and presents the process that has led to this selection.

* Which of the planetary boundaries where you least aware of?
* Go to the original [paper](http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/) and read about the boundary you were most unaware of. Try to think about how it relates to your own activities or how it might impact you.
