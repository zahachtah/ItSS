In this video Lisa Deutsch, elaborates upon the disconnect from the biosphere. She explains how utterly dependent cities are on agriculture for food and how despite this fact, those of us that are urban dwellers, remain often completely disconnected from where our food comes from and how it is made. This is in huge part due to global trade. She describes changing agricultural trends and explains the unique challenges surrounding the nexus of food, cities and sustainability. Finally, she outlines examples of how food production in city scapes look now and how it might look in the future.
