We have now spent most of our time getting a grip of the problem, from planetary boundaries to our disconnection from the biosphere. We will now start __taking aim at the goal__. The concept of sustainability captures this in a general way, but in this module of the course we will get into the details of __what to sustain, how to find indices that can guide actions and how to agree on which indices to use__. This section focuses mostly on the big picture view of sustainability from a national governance  perspective. This involves understanding the interactions between the components that provide well-being, and the effect of human actions on these components.
 In later modules we will look at more bottom up approaches to achieve the same goals. We will end this module by taking a look at the debate about how to value the future; something that is largely a controversial issue for national and international governance.
