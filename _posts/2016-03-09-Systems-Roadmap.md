In this module we are going back to __understanding the problem__, or more specifically, the system. While it may feel at time rather abstract, understanding general system dynamics is at the core of the new paradigms in sustainability science. There are three main reasons for this.

**First**, Living systems are interdependent at many different scales. Understanding this interdependence, and the consequences of focusing on a subsystem embedded in a larger context is pivotal.

**Secondly**, Living systems have variation among components and interactions at all levels. This variation is the base on which selective processes act and are thus fundamental of any adaptive process such as learning or adaptive management.

**Thirdly**, Living systems are non-linear and thus exhibit a wide range of dynamics. Understanding change in complex adaptive systems is important for understanding how to manage these.
